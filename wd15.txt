Queen Mothers Cake

This moist cake is delicious simply iced with a chocolate ganache or you can serve it with a spoonful of whipped cream and a few berries for a more festive dessert. I’ve added vanilla to the cake because in my way of thinking chocolate and vanilla just belong together.

For the Cake

6 ounces almond meal or almond flour

6 ounces semisweet chocolate (about 60% cocoa), chopped (do not use morsels!)

3⁄4 cup sugar

6 ounces (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter

6 large eggs, separated

1 tablespoon vanilla

1⁄8 tsp. salt

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

For the Ganache

1⁄2 cup heavy cream

2 teaspoons instant espresso or coffee powder

8 ounces bittersweet chocolate (70 to 72% cocoa), chopped
